                    <p class="mb-3">When working remotely and having to manage your own time, it is not uncommon for breaks to be overlooked. A new survey by the online scheduling platform Doodle confirms the US workforce’s collective neglect of breaks. 72% of US employees admit to feeling less burnt out by blocking their calendars. Despite this, only 14% of workers say they actually enjoy their scheduled breaks without interruption.</p>

                    <h4 class="mt-4">Rising Healthcare Costs Affecting Small Business</h4>
                    <p class="mb-4">The findings of the survey are important as they confirm that the rising cost of healthcare including prescription drugs are a major concern for small businesses. Many small business owners are of the belief that the financial implications of healthcare and prescription drugs are hindering business growth. Small Business for America’s Future Co-Chair Erika Gonzalez, an Allergy and Asthma Medical Professional and small business owner based in San Antonio, commented on the urgency of the situation.</p>

                    <p>These experts make strong cases, and they satisfy my natural instinct not to go there. But I remain very interested in the reasons the ’20s appeal to our imagination right now. Of course, it’s the booze, the sex, and the parties. But it’s also a decade with a very strong identity—and I think that helps. Writing in the journal American Speech in 1951, Mamie J. Meredith argued that the ’20s boasted.</p>
                    <p>I’d argue that Meredith’s point about the decade’s exceptionality still holds: How many other 20th century decades have a nice little permanent descriptor like Roaring? It helps that most of these are good adjectives, evoking a time you’d probably like to live through again—but even the slightly dangerous-sounding ones conjure up something specific. That definiteness offers an appealing sense.</p>

                    <p>Anyway, let’s get to that fun. A very joyful book to read about the decade is Frederick Lewis Allen’s Only Yesterday: An Informal History of the 1920s, which Allen—a blueblood journalist and editor at Harper’s—published in 1931. The book chronicles all of the movement and motion that makes the decade sexy, and doesn’t seem to miss a fad.</p>
